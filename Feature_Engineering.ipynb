        "- A parameter is a value that is passed into a function, method, or procedure to customize or control its behavior. It acts like a placeholder or input variable that allows the function to operate on different data without rewriting the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is correlation?\n",
        "- Correlation is a statistical technique that measures the degree of relationship between two or more variables. It indicates how changes in one variable are associated with changes in another. The purpose of correlation analysis is to quantify the strength and direction of the linear relationship between variables.\n",
        "\n",

        "4. How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?\n",
        "-The loss value is a key indicator in machine learning that quantifies the error or difference between the predicted output and the actual target value. It is derived from a mathematical function called the loss function, which guides the learning process of a model.\n",

        "Importance of Loss Value:\n",
        "Performance Indicator:\n",
        "\n",
        "A low loss value indicates that the model’s predictions are close to the actual values, signifying good performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "A high loss value reflects a large error, indicating poor model predictions.\n",

        "5. What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",
        "-Continuous and categorical variables are two fundamental types of data used in statistics and machine learning. A continuous variable is numerical and can take any value within a range, including decimals or fractions—examples include height, weight, and temperature. In contrast, a categorical variable represents distinct groups or categories and is non-numerical in nature—examples include gender, marital status, or product type. While continuous variables are measurable and allow arithmetic operations, categorical variables are used for labeling and classification without mathematical meaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. How do we handle categorical variables in Machine Learning? What are the common techniques?\n",
        "- In machine learning, categorical variables are handled by converting them into numerical formats since most algorithms require numerical input. Common techniques include Label Encoding, which assigns a unique number to each category and is suitable for ordinal data; One-Hot Encoding, which creates binary columns for each category and is ideal for nominal data; and Ordinal Encoding, used when categories have a meaningful order. For variables with many unique categories, Binary Encoding or Frequency Encoding can be more efficient. The choice of technique depends on the type of data, the algorithm used, and the number of unique category levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?\n",
        "-Training and testing a dataset refers to the process of splitting the available data into two parts to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model. The training dataset is used to teach the model by allowing it to learn patterns and relationships within the data. Once the model is trained, it is evaluated on the testing dataset, which contains unseen data, to assess how well it generalizes to new inputs. This helps ensure the model performs accurately not just on the data it was trained on but also on real-world or future data.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is sklearn.preprocessing?\n",
        "- sklearn.preprocessing is a module in the Scikit-learn library that provides a variety of tools for data preprocessing and transformation before applying machine learning algorithms. It includes functions and classes for scaling features (e.g., StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler), encoding categorical variables (e.g., LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder, OrdinalEncoder), normalizing data, handling missing values, and generating polynomial features. Proper preprocessing ensures that the data is in a suitable format and scale, improving the performance and accuracy of machine learning models.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a Test set?\n",
        "- A test set is a portion of the dataset that is used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model after it has been trained. It contains data that the model has never seen before, allowing us to measure how well the model can generalize to new, unseen data. The test set helps in assessing the model’s accuracy, precision, recall, and other evaluation metrics, and ensures that the model is not just memorizing the training data but can perform well in real-world scenarios.\n",

        "10. How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?\n",
        "How do you approach a Machine Learning problem?\n",
        "- To split data for model fitting in Python, we commonly use the train_test_split() function from Scikit-learn’s model_selection module, which divides the dataset into training and testing sets, typically in an 80:20 or 70:30 ratio. This ensures the model learns from one part of the data and is evaluated on another to test its generalization. When approaching a machine learning problem, the general steps include: understanding the problem, collecting and cleaning data, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection/engineering, splitting the data, choosing a suitable algorithm, training the model, evaluating it using metrics like accuracy or F1-score, and finally tuning and deploying the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. Why do we have to perform EDA before fitting a model to the data?\n",
        "-We perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) before fitting a model to the data because it helps us understand the structure, quality, and patterns within the dataset. EDA allows us to detect missing values, outliers, duplicate records, and incorrect data types, which can negatively impact model performance. It also helps in identifying important features, understanding relationships between variables, and spotting data imbalances or skewness. By visualizing and summarizing the data, EDA ensures that we make informed decisions during preprocessing and model selection, ultimately leading to more accurate and reliable models.\n",

        "\n",
        "13. What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "-Negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease, and vice versa. In other words, the two variables move in opposite directions. The correlation coefficient for a negative correlation lies between –1 and 0. A value of –1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, while values closer to 0 indicate a weaker negative relationship. For example, there is often a negative correlation between exercise time and body weight—as exercise time increases, body weight may decrease.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. How can you find correlation between variables in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, the correlation between variables can be found using the corr() method provided by the Pandas library. This method calculates the pairwise correlation coefficients between numeric columns in a DataFrame. The most commonly used correlation method is Pearson’s correlation, which measures the linear relationship between two variables and returns a value between –1 and +1. A value close to +1 indicates strong positive correlation, close to –1 indicates strong negative correlation, and around 0 indicates no linear correlation. Other correlation methods like Spearman and Kendall can also be specified for ranked or ordinal data. Correlation analysis is a key step in data exploration to identify relationships between features before building machine learning models.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is causation? Explain difference between correlation and causation with an example.Causation refers to a relationship where one variable directly affects or brings about a change in another variable. In other words, causation implies a cause-and-effect connection, where changes in one variable are responsible for changes in the other. Establishing causation requires evidence, often through experiments or controlled studies, and cannot be concluded based on observation alone.\n",
        "\n",
        "Difference Between Correlation and Causation:\n",
        "Correlation is a statistical association between two variables, where they tend to change together, but one does not necessarily cause the other to change.\n",

        "Causation means that one variable is the reason for the change in another variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "There may be a correlation between ice cream sales and drowning incidents—both tend to increase in summer—but ice cream does not cause drowning.\n",
